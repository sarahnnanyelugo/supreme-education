          <p>
            The school provides comfortable hostel accommodation under the
            supervision of experienced hostel parents. Students are taught to be
            independent as well as co-exist with one another. Boys and girls are
            housed in separate hostels. Each floor of the hostels has a common
            room, adequate sanitary facilities, and a hostel parentâ€™s apartment.
            We have taken special care to ensure that the hostels are homes
            where students feel secure and happy.
